# Markdown to HTML

## Repository Description:

Welcome to **alx-frontend-for-fun** repository!

This repository houses a fun project aimed at exploring the wonders of Markdown and its transformation into HTML. Ever wondered how GitHub renders those README.md files? Well, wonder no more! Our project, markdown2html.py, is here to demystify the process for you.

## Requirements:

- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using Python3 (version 3.7 or higher).
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory.
- Your code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7.*).
- All your files must be executable.
- All your modules should be documented: `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`.
- Your code should not be executed when imported (by using `if __name__ == "__main__":`).

## Tasks Overview:

1. **Start a script:** Begin your journey by crafting a Python script, `markdown2html.py`, which converts Markdown files into HTML. Ensure it handles file inputs and outputs with finesse.

2. **Headings:** Dive deeper into Markdown syntax by parsing and transforming headings into their respective HTML counterparts.

3. **Unordered Listing:** Enhance `markdown2html.py` to handle unordered listing syntax, turning those dashes into neat HTML bullet points.

4. **Ordered Listing:** Level up your script to deal with ordered listing syntax, transforming asterisks into numbered HTML lists.

5. **Simple Text:** Master the art of paragraph parsing in Markdown, converting plain text into structured HTML paragraphs.

6. **Bold and Emphasis Text:** Embrace the power of bold and emphasis in Markdown, rendering them into their HTML equivalents.

7. **Special Transformations:** Explore unconventional Markdown transformations, from MD5 hashing to content filtering, and see how they translate into HTML.
